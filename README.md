# rust-crypto-wasm

This is a fork of [rust-crypto](https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto) that was taken from the [rust-cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/rust-cardano) project. `rust-crypto` has issues with WASM and `rust-cardano` haven't published their crate. So we're publishing it from here to be used in Buttercup.
